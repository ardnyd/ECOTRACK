                    Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) Sinar Mas has reinforced its commitment to forest protection and restoration through the implementation of its Forest Conservation Policy (FCP). This policy aims to completely halt deforestation within APP's concession areas, with a strong focus on peatland ecosystems. The company also prioritizes restoring degraded landscapes that have suffered from environmental damage. By adopting this approach, APP seeks to balance its business operations with sustainability and environmental responsibility. These efforts reflect the company's long-term vision for forest conservation in Indonesia.

                    <br>
                    As part of the FCP, APP has identified 10 priority landscapes that require focused conservation and restoration efforts. These landscapes address key environmental themes, such as sustainable fiber sourcing, biodiversity preservation, and peatland management. In addition, the program includes community empowerment initiatives to ensure local involvement and social benefits. APP also integrates climate change mitigation and sustainable water and emissions management into these projects. By addressing these interconnected areas, the company aims to achieve broader ecological and social impacts.
                    <br><br>
                    To enhance the effectiveness of these initiatives, APP has assembled a specialized peatland expert team. This team includes international experts from Deltares and Euroconsult Mott MacDonald who provide technical guidance and develop best management practices for peat ecosystems. Their expertise helps ensure that restoration strategies are based on scientific research and international standards. The company hopes these efforts will significantly contribute to Indonesia's national emission reduction targets. Furthermore, APP encourages other companies to adopt similar environmental protection measures to safeguard global forest resources.
