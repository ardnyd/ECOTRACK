                    Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) Group, in collaboration with YKAN (Yayasan Konservasi Alam Nusantara), Temasek, and UBS, launched a three-year mangrove conservation project from 2021 to 2024 in Ogan Komering Ilir, South Sumatra. This program aims to restore and conserve mangrove ecosystems through various integrated approaches. Activities include mangrove planting, sustainable coastal management, and community-based conservation efforts. The project also focuses on building community awareness through education and outreach programs. These initiatives highlight APP Group’s commitment to environmental sustainability and coastal ecosystem protection.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the key components of the program is the implementation of mangrove-shrimp aquaculture systems that balance environmental restoration with economic benefits. The project also established school education programs to increase environmental awareness among younger generations. To support governance, a South Sumatra Mangrove Task Force was formed and legally recognized. Furthermore, the project contributed to the development of a Provincial Mangrove Management Plan. These actions aim to strengthen local capacity in managing and protecting mangrove areas.
                    <br><br>
                    The collaborative effort also led to the establishment of the Mangrove Ecosystem Restoration Alliance (MERA), promoting multi-stakeholder involvement in coastal conservation. Pilot aquaculture ponds were created to demonstrate sustainable livelihood models for local communities. The project additionally facilitated social forestry licensing to empower coastal residents in managing mangrove resources. These initiatives are designed to create long-term socioeconomic and environmental benefits for the region. Overall, the program reflects a comprehensive approach to restoring coastal resilience and biodiversity.
