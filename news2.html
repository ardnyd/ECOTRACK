                    APP Sinar Mas, in collaboration with a Japanese NGO, carried out a forest restoration program in Riau by planting 10,000 trees. This initiative aims to rehabilitate degraded land while improving the welfare of surrounding communities through local participation. The tree planting activity is part of a broader effort to restore forest ecosystems. It also serves as a contribution to climate change mitigation efforts.

            In addition, APP Sinar Mas, together with the Yayasan Inisiatif Dagang Hijau (IDH), Gerakan Cinta Desa (G-Cinde), local government, and communities, is implementing a peatland landscape restoration program in the Sembilang region, Musi Banyuasin, South Sumatra. The project targets the recovery of approximately 202,528 hectares of peatland damaged by the 2015 forest fires. As part of the program, local villagers, especially women, are empowered through activities such as establishing plant nurseries. This initiative not only restores degraded ecosystems but also provides economic benefits for the local population.

            By the following year, the restoration program aims to recover 12,708 hectares of peatland within the same landscape. This target is part of a multi-stakeholder collaboration designed to strengthen the ecological function of the peatland. The restoration activities include land rewetting, revegetation, and community engagement. In addition to improving environmental quality, the program is expected to enhance local livelihoods and reduce the risk of future peatland fires.
