                    Jakarta - Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) Sinar Mas has once again collaborated with Japanese NGO Great Forest Wall to plant 10 thousand tree seedlings. The planting was carried out on 20 hectares of land in the Giam Siak Kecil area, Riau. This planting also involved the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO), Belantara Foundation, and the local community. "Our activity has been going on for 6 years together with the Japanese stakeholder community there and nature-loving volunteers to facilitate them in planting in conservation areas with 10 thousand seedlings and will plant in degraded areas in APP supplier concessions," said APP Sinar Mas Sustainability and Stakeholder Engagement Director, Elim Sritaba, at the 6th Anniversary of the 10,000 Tree Planting Initiative, Riau, Tuesday (3/9/2019).

                    Meanwhile, the Executive Director of the Great Forest Wall Project Makoto Nikkawa said that sustainable forest development is very important now. Moreover, to maintain the balance of nature, cooperation from all parties is needed. He was also enthusiastic about the forest restoration cooperation program which was once the idea of Professor Akira Miyawaki and was optimistic that it would continue.

                    On the other hand, the representative of the Riau Environment and Forestry Service, Zaelani, said that the local government had done various ways to restore forests in Riau.
        
                    Currently, there are hundreds of hectares of degraded forests in 25 villages in 3 districts, one of which is in Giam Siak. "Incidentally, the location of Giam Siak is not far from the city, only 30 km. Of course, we hope that this (planting) can be followed up in other locations. We support this restoration," he said.

                    For information, this program has been running for 6 years. This is in line with the recommendations of a plant ecologist from Yokohama National University in Japan, Professor Akira Miyawaki. During his visit to the company's conservation area in 2014, Miyawaki recommended planting endemic plant species to accelerate the recovery of damaged forests. Since then, 42,000 trees from various local species have been planted in 87 hectares of the conservation area.
